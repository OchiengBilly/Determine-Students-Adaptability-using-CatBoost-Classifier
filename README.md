# Determine-Students-Adaptability-using-Random-Forest
This is a project that tries to predict the eligibility of a student to excel in online learning based on a number of factors.

Since your features are categorical, you need models that work well with categorical data:

1. Decision Trees
Works well with categorical data without requiring one-hot encoding.
Handles non-linear relationships and interactions between variables.
Easy to interpret.

2. Random Forest
An ensemble of decision trees, reducing overfitting and improving accuracy.
Handles categorical data well, but may require encoding.

3. Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
CatBoost is the best option since it natively supports categorical variables.
LightGBM and XGBoost require encoding but perform well on tabular data.

4. Logistic Regression
A simple baseline model for classification.
Requires categorical encoding (one-hot encoding or ordinal encoding).

5. Na√Øve Bayes
Works well with categorical data and small datasets.
Assumes feature independence (which may not always hold).

Best Model Choice
If you want simplicity, start with Decision Tree or Random Forest.
If you want high accuracy, use CatBoost (best for categorical data).
If you want speed, try LightGBM.
